Using this project comes in two stages, the first is building unikernels, and the second is building ready system images.

This project contains a modified version of solo5, you can use it to build ready unikernel images, which you then must place in the "unikernels" folder.
Then you can follow the system build isntructions to create a ready system image, it will package all of your files placed in the "unikernels" into the runtime for use.

//This is a test note, more details will be added as parts of the project are completed.
